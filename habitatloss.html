    <p class="print">
Most of the <a href="https://www.everythingconnects.org/main-types-of-habitat-loss.html">habitat loss</a> around the world is caused by the land conversion for development.
Much of it was done by settlers from long ago when they turned forests and prairies into croplands. Today, there is even more pressure to turn these things into buildings,
homes, towns, cities, factories and more. Because of this around half of the world's original forest have disappeared and are still being removed at a rate 10x faster. It's getting harder
and harder for animals to find food and shelter with the little space they have left in the world. Sometimes animals fight amongst themselves just for some food. Freshwater wildlife are also
impacted by pollution. Pollutants such as untreated sewage, mining waste, fertilizers, and pesticides end up in rivers, lakes, and wetlands and eventually end up in our food.
Now, think about this. The more you cut down trees, the less oxygen you're getting. So basically humans are trying to get less oxygen. This may seem crazy, but think about it
logically.
