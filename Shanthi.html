This quote is reinforcing this concept which should be brought about in our daily lives. Tha amount of happiness and satisfaction we get at the end of each day is dependent on the way we control our thoughts. Maintaining our thoughts on positive events and all things positive, at the end of that dya, we will be taken over by positivity which will make you feel happiness. The more hapinness in life, the more enjoyable and better life becomes and we appreciate everything that comes along in life more. Though it may take time to avoid thinking in the wrong direction, start by keeping your mind in a close relationship with looking at positive things that makes the mind smile. Obviously it is imposiible to completly void certain thoughts, but our goal is to keep at the least, the majority of the thoughts positive. And like for everything in life, always keep trying and working hard towards your goal. </center> </p>

It is explaining something that we might not realize when we are doing it but thinking about later, we realize this fact. We see this in severla instances in our life. Even with a simple smile, it shows a perswon who seees you that you are ahppy which puts a smile on their face making them happy as well. What do you know, now you have spread smiles across so many people's faces making not only your day, but their day happy. When you put a smile on someone else's face and know that you have made their day better, you atomatically sense a feeling of satisfaction which brings positivity into your mind that you have done something good and helped people. This positivity then turns into happiness and has an impact on your entire day. Usually you do this without realizing you are doing it and making yourself happier. I challenge you to go out today and do this and see for yourslef how it makes you feel. I am sure you will have a 10 times better of a day. </center></p>
