  <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
  <p class="print"><a href="http://www.cleanerandgreener.org/resources/air-pollution.html">Air Pollution</a> is caused directly by using electricity, fuel, and
  transportation. It is <em>also</em> caused indirectly when we buy goods and services that use energy in their delivery. When it comes to health, this causes a
  big problem. Some emissions are hazardous to humans' health,including lead, mercury, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, carbon dioxide, and ozone forming nitrogen
  dioxides. Toxic compounds like, mercury and lead, poison organal systems causing brain damage and maybe even death. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides combine with
  water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. This is extremely harmful to forests and can deteriorate monuments and buildings. Climate change has been caused by
  increased emissions in carbon dioxide, which causes big consequences.</p>

  <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
    <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities. <strong>How is it caused?</strong> Many industries do not have a
  proper waste management system and drain waste and toxins into fresh water. The toxic in the chemicals can cause a serious hazard to water organisms. Oil poses a
  huge threat to water species when spilled. Since oil does not dissolve in water, sea creatures eat it and get poisoning. The particles from the burning of fossil
  fuels also causes a threat to water. The ash combines with water vapor in the atmosphere and causes acid rain. As more cities and towns are developed, the need for
  more fertilizers is increasing. The remains after cutting down trees erode into sewage systems and pollute our water. <a href="https://www.simsbury-ct.gov/water-pollution-control/pages/ten-things-you-can-do-to-reduce-water-pollution">Here are 10 things you can do to prevent water pollution</a>
